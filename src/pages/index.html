  <p class="mt-8 text-md">Greetings ðŸ‘‹</p>

  <p class="mt-4">I believe in the beauty and diversity of the world. Everything I do is to enjoy every piece of it. In doing so, I choose to live a simple and intentional life. I love the work and colleagues I work with, I consume only the things I need, live without clutter and burden to the past. Then contribute to society in a useful way. </p>

  <p class="mt-4">My name is David Adi Nugroho and I am a self-taught Software Developer.</p>

  <p class="mt-4">I solve problems using technological advancement that the world has to offer. I believe programming languages are only tools to solve such problems. But I happen to be comfortable with backend side and familiar with PHP/Laravel. I also know how the network and server works. I can make sure an app works from the ground up to alive in the cloud.</p>

  <p class="mt-4">Do you believe in solving problems using technology too?</p>
