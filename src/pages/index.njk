    i believe in the beauty and diversity of the world. everything i do is to
    enjoy every piece of it. in doing so, i choose to live a simple and
    intentional life. i love the work and colleagues i work with, i consume
    only the things i need, live without clutter and burden to the past.
    then contribute to society in a useful way.

    i solve problems using technological advancement that the world has to
    offer. i believe programming languages are only tools to solve such
    problems. but i happen to be comfortable with backend side and familiar
    with php/laravel. i also know how the network and server works. i can make
    sure an app works from the ground up to alive in the cloud.
